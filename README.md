# LinearAlgebra

Linear algebra is among most important operations of the computational era, providing a foundation for nearly all of the data methods. This repository provides a numerically solution and visualization to linear algebra problems. Theory and example was given and can be used for a variety purposes.

Understanding the concept of Linear algebra and underlying algorithm will result in a good understanding of how computers and operations work in the fields of machine learning, data science etc.

## This repository is divided into 6 chapters:

Chapter 1 : Introduction of Gaussian elemination and visualization for systems that have solution and didn't have a solution
Chapter 2 : The property of matrix and visualization of vector and matrix operations.
Chapter 3 : Introduce a formal defintion of what is known as a vector space over the real numbers.
Chapter 4 : Introduce what is known as a linear transformation
Chapter 5 : Introduce how to put a system of equations into matrix form
Chapter 6 : Properties of complex numbers, vectors, and matrices.
