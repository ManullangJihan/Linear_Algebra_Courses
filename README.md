# LinearAlgebra

Linear algebra is among most important operations of the computational era, providing a foundation for nearly all of the data methods. This repository provides a numerically solution and visualization to linear algebra problems. Theory and example was given and can be used for a variety purposes.

Understanding the concept of Linear algebra and underlying algorithm will result in a good understanding of how computers and operations work in the fields of machine learning, data science etc.
